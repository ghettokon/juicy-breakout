Juicy Breakout
==============

An example that we made for a talk at Nordic Game Indie Night: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg

You can try the game here: http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/

A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do
tons of cascading action and response for minimal user input.
